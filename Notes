Error: VERR_DISK_FULL.
    Problem: not enough memory on the host to create a new stuff.
    Solution: extend the host VM storage size from VirtualBox. Run 'gparted' in the VM once done and extend the partition.
Error: VERR_VMX_NO_VMX.
    Problem: nested VMs not allowed on machine.
    Solution: Try to enable that option from VirtualBox app in the "Processor" options. Its the last box. If option is greyed out: run 'VboxManage modifyvm <name of vm> --nested-hm-virt on'
Error:
    Problem: machine stuck during the boot at Authentication Failure
